I utilized the NASA Battery Dataset to analyze and predict battery capacity. Since a single dataset contained limited data, 
I merged four datasets: "07562.csv, 07563.csv, 07564.csv, and 07567.csv" to create a more comprehensive dataset for training and evaluation.

To predict battery capacity, I employed a Machine Learning approach using the Random Forest Regression model. 
This model was chosen due to its ability to handle complex relationships between features, robustness against overfitting, and high predictive accuracy. 
After training and testing the model on the merged dataset, it achieved an impressive 99% accuracy in predicting battery capacity.

The high accuracy indicates that the model effectively learns the relationship between input features
(such as impedance, cycle count, voltage, and other battery characteristics) and battery capacity. This approach can be useful for battery health monitoring,
lifespan estimation, and predictive maintenance, providing valuable insights for real-world applications.
